    "## Classes and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "classes and methods are fundamental parts of coding.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Classes are a template for creating something. It defines what properties and behaviors the object should have. \n",
    "\n",
    " - For example the class car would define the color, the model, year released, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Methods are an action that an object executes.\n",
    "\n",
    " - For example in the car example a method could be drive() or brake()\n",
    "\n",
    " - here is an example Code Runner using the example above. The code first creates a class which in this case is a car. It then defines the different properties of the car such as the brand, the color, and the speed. Lastly the method accelerate is defined, which increases speed by 10.\n"

    "## Why do you use Classes and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    " - Methods are used because they help keep the code simple. Instead of typing out a specific process everytime, you could just define a method once and then execute the method as needed.\n",
    "  \n",
    " - For example if you are making a video game you can make a method called take damage which causes the player to lose health.\n",
    "\n",
    " - You would use classes to organize the code and when you have a set of data that goes together such as player, monster, ally etc."
