    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When I first walked into CSSE 1, I had little knowledge about computer science. I didn't know how to create a github repository or use VSCode. Now by the end of this class, I can proudly say I have made my own portfolio on a github repository through coding in VSCode!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to work effectively in this class, I first had to set up my tools. At first, I used a kasm server on google chromebook to use my tools unblocked. However, there were problems with Kasm so I had to switch to windows. I was already familiar with setting up tools, so the process was very easy for me. I had to get used to working on a windows computer and I liked using it a lot more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of our first tasks in this class was to create a game and submit it to APCSP and APCSA students to grade us. The game I worked on was the cookie clicker game. This game that I worked on is defintely a key accomplishment from CSSE 1. I made the game through OOP coding which is Object-Oriented Programming.\n",

    "## My Role as a Scrum Master\n",
    "\n",
    "As a scrum master, it is your job to keep your group on task, coordinate with your group, and be organized. Being a scrum master, I always made sure my team turned in everything on time and kept track of new updates. One main thing that helped make my group be organized is assigning roles. To split work, everyone would do one thing and we would combine it into one. For example, when we taught arrays, everyone spoke about one part in the lesson demonstrating what we individually worked on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the murder mystery game, we all combined our ideas onto a whiteboard and chose as a group what we wanted our level to look like. This helped us create our level because we already knew what we were going to do. So in the end, we created our level successfully with no errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Now at the ending of CSSE 1, I can proudly say I know how to use github, work with others more effectively, and code a simple game!"
