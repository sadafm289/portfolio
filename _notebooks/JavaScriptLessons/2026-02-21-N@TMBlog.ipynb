    "At night of the museum, there were multiple electives/classrooms which showcased their creativity and design through projects, items, and presentations. For example, in the art classrooms, they had many tables displaying their creations for others to observe. In the computer science classroom, students from APCSP and APCSA presented their projects on screens. As a CSSE student, it was very interesting getting to see what APCSP and APCSA students are working on and building!\n",

    "I got to see other electives which made me interested. For example, the art classrooms had amazing creations which were cool to see! I enjoyed how they put all their designs in a gallery for everyone to walk past and it was very organized. Similar to Computer Science, there were people presenting on TV's and if you were interested, you could go to a TV and see what is being presented.\n",
